## Frontend Technical Assessment 🚀

### Overview

We want to see your skills with React and TypeScript. You'll be given a Figma design to replicate in a Vite project using Tailwind CSS. Plus, you'll use an AirOps app to fetch and display data.

### What You'll Do
1. **Fork the Repo**: You'll get a barebones Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project. Fork it and get started.
2. **Design Implementation**: Copy the Figma design into your project. Make it look as close as possible.
3. **Data Integration**: [Create an AirOps Workflow](https://docs.airops.com/building-workflows/workflow-concepts) that returns the necessary mock data for the design and [execute it](https://github.com/airopshq/airops-js) to display the mock data! 📊

![Example of Airops App for the Data Integration](https://github.com/airopshq/fe-technical-assessment/blob/main/public/airpos-app-run-once-example.png)

> Note: if you need to do any create, edit or delete, it doesn’t need to persist anywhere outside of the React state.

### Time Frame
Try to finish within 3 hours. ⏰

### What We Care About
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-structured code. 💻
- **Design Accuracy**: Your app should look like the Figma design. 🎨
- **Functionality**: Your app should fetch and display data correctly. 🔄

### How to Submit
1. Fork our repo.
2. Make your changes.
